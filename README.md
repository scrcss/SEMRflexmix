# SEMRflexmix
A sequential EM Algorithm for Mixture of Regression Models. Run 
?Pflexmix 
?rec_stepPFlexmix 
in R console to see the details.

Note: this package is developed on the basis of R package 'flexmix', whose original functions are necessary to run the proposed algorithm, and thus all functions in 'flexmix' are included in this package. Please DO NOT attach 'flexmix' again to avoid the conflict of NAMESPACE.
