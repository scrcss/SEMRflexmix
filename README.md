Note: this package is developed on the basis of R package 'flexmix', whose original functions are necessary to run the proposed algorithm. For convenience of use, we included all functions and datasets in 'flexmix' in this package. Please DO NOT attach 'flexmix' again to avoid the conflict of NAMESPACE.
